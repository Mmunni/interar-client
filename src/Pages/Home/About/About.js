            What is interior of the house? Interior commonly refers to the
            inside of something. When house hunting you might find that the
            outside of the house is run down, but the interior rooms beautifully
            renovated. If you design the color scheme of a room and pick our
            furnishings for it, you are an interior designer.{" "}

          A good interior designer will balance the detail while still keeping their eyes on the big picture. Perfection is a series of small things done really well.{" "}
